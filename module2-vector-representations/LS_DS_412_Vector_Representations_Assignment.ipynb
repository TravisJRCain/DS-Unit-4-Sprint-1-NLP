We believe that ideas     to the good and not     have consequence. Our highest work is bringing rigor, insight, intellectual honesty, to that ultimate purpose of separating the bad from the good, and giving voice to the latter. Spirit of Generosity: Atlantic Media seeks in its ranks a spirit of generosity     a natural disposition in each colleague toward service and selfless conduct. Atlantic Media writing should be cut from the same cloth     critical on the merits but informed by charity and forbearance in measuring motive and personal character.
